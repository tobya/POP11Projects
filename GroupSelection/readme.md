This is a 3rd Year assignment I was given to write in [POP11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP-11) when studying Artificial Intelligence in Sussex University.

Github needs a bit more Pop11 Code on it.

This was the code for an assignment.   It was a Genetic Algorithm that was supposed to evolve to get better.  If I remember correctly it was supposed to be a Cowboy who would get better at shooting other cowboys as the generations eveolved.  I modified it somewhat to base it on a Group Selection model. 

If I remember right I got 69% for this.  I was a little miffed I didnt get an A (70%)

The main code file is

[GroupSelectionGA.pop11.TXT](GroupSelectionGA.pop11.TXT)

You can write about the assignment and what the code is supposed to do in 

[Group Selection write up.doc](Group Selection write up.doc)

There are various other files that provide backup info and the odd run through of the program.  

I do not know if it still compiles.
